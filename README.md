# Chess
I am creating a C# Chess application. Initially, I will create a simple console version of it, before worrying about a GUI. 

First I will create the board, then one by one implement each type of piece.

## Usage
To run simply download the project and open it in visual studio, then use Ctrl + F5 to run the program.
